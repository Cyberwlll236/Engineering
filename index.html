<h8>Week 3</h8>
<br/>
<h8>9/12/22</h8>
<br/>
<h8>This week we finalized our Rude Goldburg machines, adding measurements and such. For the challenge, we had to create a capital "E" with a partner using exact measurments. I found it relatively easy but that I needed to be extra careful making the measurments and that everythings adds up correctly. I also learned that Tristan, my friend, doesn't know centimeters from inches.</h8>

<h8>Week 4</h8>
<br/>
<h8>9/16/22</h8>
<h8>On monday we got into groups and began making measurements for our RG machine. On tuesday we finalized the measurments and began cutting them out. We noticed almost immediately that our group's machine was going to be much bigger than most everyone else's. We ran into some issues while making supports. We had an idea to cut down on time which was to intersect two strip of cardboard which slits cut into them but they ended up extremely unbalanced and we decided to redo it entirely. This time, we made supports with 3 solid walls which is working much better, although we had wasted quite a bit of time. This taught us to run ideas by the whole group before exectuting them. On friday we tried to make paper boats float on water with weights on them. I got lucky and was put into a group with someone with an excellent boat design. The idea was a boat with greater surface area on the bottom would float the best, and as it turns out, he was right and we came in first place with 110g.</h8>
