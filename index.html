<h8>Week 4</h8>
<br/>
<h8>9/12/22</h8>
<br/>
<h8>This week we finalized our Rude Goldburg machines, adding measurements and such. For the challenge, we had to create a capital "E" with a partner using exact measurments. I found it relatively easy but that I needed to be extra careful making the measurments and that everythings adds up correctly. I also learned that Tristan, my friend, doesn't know centimeters from inches.</h8>
